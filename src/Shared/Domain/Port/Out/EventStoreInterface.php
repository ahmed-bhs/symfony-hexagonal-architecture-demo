/**
 * Port (interface) for storing domain events.
 *
 * EventStore is a specialized storage for domain events that provides:
 * - Append-only event log (immutable history)
 * - Audit trail (who did what, when)
 * - Event replay capability (rebuild state from events)
 * - Event sourcing support (events as source of truth)
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Audit log: Track all business operations
 * - Debugging: Replay events to reproduce issues
 * - Analytics: Query historical events
 * - Event Sourcing: Reconstruct aggregate state from events
 * - CQRS: Build read models from events
 *
 * This port allows:
 * - Domain/Application layers to be independent of storage mechanism
 * - Infrastructure to implement with SQL, NoSQL, or specialized event stores
 * - Easy testing with InMemoryEventStore
 *
 * Hexagonal Architecture:
 * - Port: Defined in Shared/Domain (this interface)
 * - Adapter: Implemented in Infrastructure (e.g., DoctrineEventStore)
