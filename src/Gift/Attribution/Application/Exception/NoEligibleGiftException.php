/**
 * Application Exception: No Eligible Gift Found.
 *
 * This is an APPLICATION-level exception (NOT Domain).
 *
 * Difference between Application vs Domain exceptions:
 *
 * DOMAIN Exceptions:
 * - Invariant violations (Email format invalid)
 * - Business rule violations (Age < 0)
 * - Aggregate consistency (Cannot approve rejected request)
 * - Thrown by: Domain entities, value objects
 * - Example: InvalidEmailException, NegativeAgeException
 *
 * APPLICATION Exceptions:
 * - Use case failures (No gift available for attribution)
 * - Workflow errors (Cannot complete operation)
 * - Orchestration failures (External service unavailable)
 * - Thrown by: Command handlers, application services
 * - Example: NoEligibleGiftException, QuotaExceededException
 *
 * This exception is thrown when:
 * - No gifts available in stock
 * - No gifts match resident's criteria
 * - Resident has exceeded quota
 * - Business policy prevents attribution
